# CO_project
In this assignment, you will have to design and implement a custom assembler and a
custom simulator for a given ISA.
You are not restricted to any programming language. However, your program must read
from stdin and write to stdout.


QUESTION DESCRIPTION:
There are a total of four questions in this assignment:
1. Designing and Implementing the assembler.
2. Designing and Implementing the simulator.
3. Extending the functionality of the assembler-simulator set-up to handle simple
floating-point computations.
4. A bonus question based on the assembler and simulator.
#The bonus will be worth 10%.


DEADLINES:
You will have two deadlines for this assignment:
1. The mid-evaluation:
a. By this deadline, you must have the assembler ready.
b. You will be tested mostly on the test cases already provided to you with the
assignment.
c. However, we might add some other test cases as well.
d. You will only be evaluated on the assembler. (20%)

2. The final evaluation:
a) By this deadline, you must have both the assembler and the simulator
ready(70%).
b) You should also have completed Q3(10%).
c) You will be evaluated on a much larger set of test cases this time.
d) You will also be evaluated on the bonus question at this stage.


GRADING:
a. Q1 and Q2 are mandatory questions.
b. In Q1, you will have to make an assembler.
c. In Q2, you have to make a simulator for which detailed information is mentioned in the
respective questions.
d. Q3 is an extension of the functionality of the assembler-simulator set-up that you build.
e. Q4 is a bonus question.
