assembler.py is the main assembler file.
Change the input file name from line no. 65 in     file =  "input_file_name.txt" 
change the output file name from    out = open("output_file_name.txt","w")
the assembler will read the code from input_file_name.txt and print the output in "output_file_name.txt".
